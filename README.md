# csps-with-r

Purpose: introducing beginners to R, RStudio and the Civil Survey People Survey data.

The training is currently a single R Markdown file knitted to HTML. The HTML file will be made available online when the GitHub repo is made open.

Longer term, this should be developed into a {bookdown} project that covers far more than just the very basics of using R and RStudio. It should also demonstrate more thorough analysis of the CSPS data, like calculating percent-positive scores. 

The book should probably cover some case studies using the {cspstools} package too, as that develops.
